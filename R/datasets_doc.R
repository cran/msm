#' Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after lung transplants
#' 
#' A dataset containing histories of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)
#' from lung transplant recipients. BOS is a chronic decline in lung function,
#' often observed after lung transplantation.  The condition is classified into
#' four stages of severity: none, mild, moderate and severe.
#' 
#' The entry time of each patient into each stage of BOS was estimated by
#' clinicians, based on their history of lung function measurements and acute
#' rejection and infection episodes.  BOS is only assumed to occur beyond six
#' months after transplant.  In the first six months the function of each
#' patient's new lung stabilises.  Subsequently BOS is diagnosed by comparing
#' the lung function against the "baseline" value.
#' 
#' The objects \code{bos3} and \code{bos4} contain the same data, but with
#' mild/moderate/severe combined, and moderate/severe combined, to give 3 and
#' 4-state representations respectively.

#' observations denote the entry times into stages 2, 3, 4, representing mild,
#' moderate and severe BOS respectively, and stage 5, representing death.

#' FEV1 measurements from lung transplant recipients
#' 
#' A series of measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second
#' (FEV1) from lung transplant recipients, from six months onwards after their
#' transplant.
#' 
#' A baseline "normal" FEV1 for each individual is calculated using
#' measurements from the first six months after transplant. After six months,
#' as presented in this dataset, FEV1 is expressed as a percentage of the
#' baseline value.

#' FEV1 is monitored to diagnose bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a
#' long-term lung function decline, thought to be a form of chronic rejection.
